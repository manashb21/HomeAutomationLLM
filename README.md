## 📊 Dataset Generation & Preprocessing

- A **synthetic dataset of ~11,000 Nepali-English automation commands** was generated using OpenAI API.
- Data balancing techniques ensured **equal representation of intents, rooms, and actions**.
- The dataset was **split into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test sets**, maintaining class balance.

## 🛠️ Fine-Tuning Process

The model was fine-tuned using **LoRA and QLoRA** to optimize efficiency:

- **Base Model:** Llama 3.2 (1B)
- **Training Framework:** Unsloth (optimized for speed & efficiency)
- **Hardware:** Lightning.AI cloud GPUs (L40S, A10, T4)
- **Training Strategy:** LoRA applied to transformer layers for **low-memory adaptation**
- **Optimizer:** AdamW with **learning rate tuning using Optuna**

**Training Performance:**
- The instruct-tuned model exhibited **faster convergence** and **better validation loss** than the base model.
- Fine-tuned YAML outputs showed **higher correctness** compared to pre-trained models.

## 📏 Model Evaluation & Benchmarking

**1️⃣ Accuracy Metrics:**
- **Exact Match Accuracy:** Measures if the YAML output **exactly matches** the expected response.
- **Partial Match Accuracy:** Checks how many **key-value pairs** in YAML outputs are correctly generated.
- 85% exact match, 87% partial match accuracy

**2️⃣ Inference Efficiency:**
- **Benchmarking performed on CPU (Ryzen 7 7700 & Ryzen 5 7530U).**
- **Latency & RAM usage** tracked to measure real-world feasibility.
- **Found** low latency (0.2s inference time)

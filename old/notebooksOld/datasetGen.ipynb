    "    - Adjust brightness in percentage or qualitative terms (e.g., dim, brighten).\n",
    "    - Control lights in multiple rooms at once.\n",
    "    - Combine multiple intents, such as turning off lights in one room and dimming lights in another.\n",
    "    - Include vague or ambiguous instructions like \"Make it bright here.\"\n",
    "    - In some sentences use English word for rooms (living room, kitchen, bedroom, hallways, outdoor) and use Nepali translations given below in some. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the following Nepali translations:\n",
    "    - Living room: baithak kotha, baithak\n",
    "    - Kitchen: bhaancha kotha, bhaancha\n",
    "    - Bedroom: sutney kotha, kotha\n",
    "    - Hallway: ghar ko baato\n",
    "    - Outdoor: bahira\n",
    "    - Bright: ujyalo, chahakilo\n",
    "    - Dim: madhuro\n",
    "    - Light: batti, tube, chim\n",
    "    - increase: badhau, badhaunu\n",
    "    - decrease: ghatau, ghataunu\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ensure a 60-40 split:\n",
    "    - 60% of commands should involve kitchen, living room, and bedroom.\n",
    "    - 40% of commands should involve hallways, outdoor areas, and other rooms.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Example Commands:\n",

    "2. 'Living room lights thap bright banaunus.'\n",
    "3. 'Sabai room ka lights dim garidinus.'\n",
